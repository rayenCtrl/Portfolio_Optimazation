## The objective 

1. **Maximum Sharpe Ratio**: This results in a tangency portfolio because on a graph of returns vs risk, this portfolio corresponds to the tangent of the efficient frontier that has a y-intercept equal to the risk-free rate. This is the default option because it finds the optimal return per unit risk.

2. **Minimum Volatility**: This may be useful if you're trying to get an idea of how low the volatility could be, but in practice, it makes a lot more sense to use the portfolio that maximizes the Sharpe ratio.

3. **Efficient Return** the Markowitz portfolio, which minimizes risk for a given target return. This was the main focus of Markowitz 1952.

4. **Efficient Risk**: The Sharpe-maximizing portfolio for a given target risk.



## Portfolio Optimization

The first part of the project involves portfolio optimization. The following steps were taken:

1. **Stock Selection**: In the first step, stocks were selected based on certain criteria.
2. **Return Calculation**: Monthly and yearly returns were calculated using the historical method.
3. **Covariance Matrix**: The covariance matrix was calculated to measure the degree to which two stocks move together.
4. **Portfolio Properties**: The portfolio properties such as expected return, volatility, VaR, and Sharpe Ratio of a portfolio equiponderate were obtained.
5. **Max Sharpe Ratio Portfolio Allocation**: The allocation of the max Sharpe Ratio portfolio was calculated.
6. **Portfolio with Minimum Risk Tolerance**: The portfolio with the minimum risk tolerance was discovered.


## Stock Valuation

The second part of the project involves stock valuation. The following steps were taken:

1. **Stock Selection**: A stock like Apple was chosen.
2. **Historical Data**: Historical data and all the statements were provided in order to value the stock.
3. **Valuation Criteria**: The stock was valued according to criteria like Dividend, Gordon Shapiro, PER ratio, and Q-Tobin.
4. **Forecasting**: A forecast for time series data was made with the help of the Prophet library by Microsoft.

## Interpretation

 a risk-averse investor, could consider investing in **NVIDIA** and **Oracle** to aim for a higher return. 
 On the other hand, if you want to play it safe and go for the long run, you should consider investing in stocks like **Apple** and **Intel** to minimize the risks.

## ressources

For this project, I have chosen to use Yahoo Finance as a data source for the technology sector in the United States. Yahoo Finance provides information on stock performance, charts, news, and analysis for US technology companies. You can also find data on sector and industry performance, as well as dashboards and filters to help you examine economic performance and trends to inform your investment decisions.

Performance and analysis of the performance of US technology companies. Also the use of the data to identify market trends, company performance, and factors that influence company performance. and to perform correlation and regression analyses to identify relationships between economic variables and company performance. Finally, I used the data to perform forecasting analyses to predict future performance of Apple Stock.


### tools

There are several tools and resources available to investors. Two popular options include Yahoo Finance and Python libraries such as PyPortfolioOpt and FinQuant.

*Yahoo Finance* is a widely used platform that provides comprehensive financial information, news, and analysis for individual stocks, as well as broader market trends. Investors can access real-time stock quotes, historical price data, financial statements, analyst recommendations, and more. This platform allows users to track the performance of their portfolio holdings, create watchlists, and stay informed about market developments.

*PyPortfolioOpt* is a Python library specifically designed for portfolio optimization. It offers various algorithms and methods to help investors construct optimal portfolios based on their objectives and constraints. With PyPortfolioOpt, users can perform tasks such as asset allocation optimization, risk management analysis, backtesting investment strategies, and estimating expected returns.

*FinQuant* is another Python library that focuses on quantitative finance research and analysis. It provides tools for portfolio optimization using techniques like mean-variance optimization or Black-Litterman model. Additionally, FinQuant offers features such as backtesting investment strategies with historical data and calculating performance metrics like Sharpe ratio or maximum drawdown.


When it comes to optimizing a portfolio and evaluating an Apple stock, there are several key factors to consider. The objective of portfolio optimization is to maximize returns while minimizing risk. This involves careful stock selection and calculating the potential return on investment.

To begin, it is important to assess the properties of the portfolio. This includes understanding the risk tolerance of the investor, as this will influence the allocation of assets within the portfolio. Different investors have different levels of risk tolerance, and this should be taken into account when selecting stocks.

In evaluating an Apple stock, one can calculate its potential return by analyzing historical data and financial indicators such as earnings per share (EPS), price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), and dividend yield. These metrics provide insights into the company's financial health and growth potential.

Additionally, assessing the risk associated with investing in Apple can be done through measures such as beta and standard deviation. Beta measures how sensitive a stock is to market movements, while standard deviation indicates the volatility or dispersion of returns.

Furthermore, evaluating a portfolio's performance can be done using metrics such as Sharpe ratio. The Sharpe ratio measures the excess return generated by a portfolio per unit of risk taken. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates better risk-adjusted returns.

By considering these factors and conducting thorough analysis, investors can optimize their portfolios by selecting stocks that align with their objectives and risk tolerance while maximizing potential returns.
